# Task 8 Implementation Summary: Wallet Profiling v1

## ✅ Implementation Complete

Task 8 has been successfully implemented with comprehensive wallet profiling capabilities for detecting Snipers, Bundlers, and Insiders, plus a health scoring system.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Database Schema Updates
- **tokens table**: Added 7 new columns for profiling data
- **holders table**: Added 2 new columns for wallet classification
- **funding_edges table**: New table for funding graph analysis
- **Indexes**: Added performance indexes for all new columns

### Worker Architecture
The system consists of 6 specialized workers:

1. **Pool Locator Worker** (`pool-locator-worker.js`)
   - Detects DEX pool creation transactions
   - Identifies developer/creator wallets
   - Updates pool metadata

2. **Sniper Detector Worker** (`sniper-detector-worker.js`)
   - Identifies wallets buying within first 2 blocks after pool creation
   - Uses block-based timing for accuracy
   - Updates holder classifications

3. **Bundler Detector Worker** (`bundler-detector-worker.js`)
   - Finds wallets funding 5+ other wallets that buy the token
   - Builds funding graph from SOL transfers
   - Identifies bundling patterns

4. **Insider Detector Worker** (`insider-detector-worker.js`)
   - Uses heuristics to identify suspected insiders
   - Analyzes funding lineage and wallet age
   - Implements 2-of-3 flag system

5. **Health Score Worker** (`health-score-worker.js`)
   - Calculates 0-100 health scores
   - Uses weighted component system
   - Updates token health scores

6. **Main Wallet Profiling Worker** (`wallet-profiling-worker.js`)
   - Orchestrates all detection workers
   - Provides CLI interface
   - Generates summary reports and alerts

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### Detection Capabilities
- ✅ **Sniper Detection**: First 2 blocks after pool creation
- ✅ **Bundler Detection**: 5+ wallets funded within 15 minutes
- ✅ **Insider Detection**: Heuristic-based with 2-of-3 flags
- ✅ **Health Scoring**: 0-100 scale with weighted components

### Database Features
- ✅ **Pool Tracking**: Creation time and signature
- ✅ **Wallet Classification**: Multiple types per wallet
- ✅ **Funding Graph**: SOL transfer relationships
- ✅ **Health Metrics**: Comprehensive scoring system

### CLI Interface
- ✅ **Dashboard View**: Token table with health scores
- ✅ **Detail View**: Individual token analysis
- ✅ **Pipeline Control**: Run individual or full pipeline
- ✅ **Real-time Alerts**: High-risk and success notifications

## 📊 Health Score System

### Components (Weights sum to 100)
- **Fresh Ratio** (+35 points): Percentage of fresh wallets
- **Liquidity Quality** (+20 points): Log-scaled liquidity amount
- **Sniper Ratio** (-15 points): Percentage of sniper wallets
- **Insider Ratio** (-20 points): Percentage of insider wallets
- **Top 10 Concentration** (-10 points): Concentration of top holders

### Scoring Logic
```javascript
healthScore = clamp(
  35 * freshRatio + 
  20 * liquidityScore - 
  15 * sniperRatio - 
  20 * insiderRatio - 
  10 * top10Concentration, 
  0, 100
)
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### CLI Commands
```bash
# Show wallet profiling dashboard
npm run cli -- profiling

# Show detailed token analysis
npm run cli -- profiling-detail <MINT>

# Run full profiling pipeline
npm run cli -- profiling-run

# Run individual workers
npm run cli -- profiling-pool
npm run cli -- profiling-sniper
npm run cli -- profiling-bundler
npm run cli -- profiling-insider
npm run cli -- profiling-health
```

### Programmatic Usage
```javascript
const { mainLoop } = require('./workers/wallet-profiling-worker');
await mainLoop(); // Run full pipeline
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Detection Parameters
- **Sniper Window**: 2 blocks after pool creation
- **Bundler Threshold**: 5 wallets funded within 15 minutes
- **Insider Heuristics**: 2-of-3 flags (shared funder, fresh wallet, top holder)
- **Analysis Window**: First 60 minutes of token life

### Performance Settings
- **Transaction Limit**: 500 tx per cycle
- **Batch Size**: 10-20 tokens per run
- **API Delays**: 500ms-2s between requests
- **Idempotency**: Re-runs overwrite existing flags

## 📈 Alert System

### High-Risk Alerts
- Health score < 30
- Insider ratio > 20%
- Sniper ratio > 30%

### Success Alerts
- Health score > 70
- High fresh wallet ratio
- Good liquidity metrics

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Script
- `test-wallet-profiling.js` - Comprehensive test with sample data
- Demonstrates all functionality with realistic examples
- Shows dashboard and detail views

### Test Results
```
✅ Test token inserted
✅ Test holders inserted  
✅ Test funding edges inserted
✅ Dashboard display working
✅ Detail view working
✅ Health score calculation working
```
